# streetVision

## Description

streetVision is an interactive web application that allows users to draw areas on a map and generate equidistant points along the roads within those areas. Utilizing the Leaflet library for map visualization and Turf.js for geospatial data manipulation, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface for exploring and downloading data in GeoJSON format.

## Features

- **Area Drawing**: Users can draw rectangles on the map to define the area of interest.
- **Point Generation**: The app automatically generates equidistant points along the roads within the drawn area.
- **GeoJSON Download**: Users can download the generated points in GeoJSON format for later use.
- **Intuitive Controls**: The user interface includes simple controls to start drawing, clear the map, and download data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the structure and styling of the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For the application logic.
- **Leaflet**: For map visualization.
- **Leaflet Draw**: For drawing shapes on the map.
- **Turf.js**: For geospatial data manipulation.
